Elevator Robot
-Locate grid of buttons by scanning walls
  - Move forward until a wall is reached (Wall A)
  - Scan walls for a grid of buttons while moving left along Wall A until another wall is reached (Wall B)
    -if grid of buttons is located, stop
  - Continue scanning wall for grid of buttons while moving left until corner is reached (Wall C)
    -if grid of buttons is located, stop
  - Continue scanning wall while moving left until corner is reached (Wall D)
    -if grid of buttons is located, stop
  - Continue scanning wall while moving left until corner is reached (Wall A)
-If grid of buttons can not be located, say "I can not find the elevator buttons" and route home
-Otherwise: Determine what floor to go to
    -If desired floor is known, continue to next step

      - Say "What floor would you like to go to?" to valid response (refer to elevator floors for valid responses)
      -Wait 8 seconds for reply
      -If no valid response, repeat previous steps twice
        -If no response, route home
      -If numeric response was recorded, continue to next step
#Press button
  -Locate the desired floor on the grid based on number or text
    -If floor is not valid, return to previous determining floor
    -Otherwise press the button in which number or text is located
