# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? Why is it useful?

    Version control is a way to document changes to files. It is useful because new versions will have changes documented and bugs can be more easily identified. Additionally, changes can be rolled back by going back to an older version.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

   A branch is a line of development.  Branches are often used in order to allow for development of a project without effecting the main or master branch. It also allows for multiple people to work on the same project concurrently. Multiple branches can be merged together and to the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

    A commit is a documented change to a file or files. A good commit message includes the action or change that was made.

* What is a merge conflict?
    A merge conflict occurs when the master branch has been changed since the merging branch started development. These merge conflicts must be resolved before committing changes. They may be resolved by deciding on either choosing the change from one of the branches or using new code for the section that's causing the conflict. These changes can then be commited if all merge conflicts have been resolved.
